======================
Oxford Bus Mobile Site
======================

The Oxontime website isn't very good. This application gives a nice mobile site that will give you live bus times. It uses geo.js to get location, a scraper I wrote to get at the data on ACIS websites (also on GitHub at https://github.com/matthewowen/BusScraper), and a subset of the NAPTAN bus stop data (stored in an sqlite3 database included in this repository).

It relies on the busscraper continuing to work, which relies on them not changing the markup. Let's hope, eh? 

If you just want to use it, head to http://www.oxbus.co.uk/

Contribution, improvements, suggestions are all gratefully received.
